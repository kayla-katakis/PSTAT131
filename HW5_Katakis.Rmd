## Homework 5

For this assignment, we will be working with the file `"pokemon.csv"`, found in `/data`. The file is from Kaggle: <https://www.kaggle.com/abcsds/pokemon>.

The [Pokémon](https://www.pokemon.com/us/) franchise encompasses video games, TV shows, movies, books, and a card game. This data set was drawn from the video game series and contains statistics about 721 Pokémon, or "pocket monsters." In Pokémon games, the user plays as a trainer who collects, trades, and battles Pokémon to (a) collect all the Pokémon and (b) become the champion Pokémon trainer.

Each Pokémon has a [primary type](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Type) (some even have secondary types). Based on their type, a Pokémon is strong against some types, and vulnerable to others. (Think rock, paper, scissors.) A Fire-type Pokémon, for example, is vulnerable to Water-type Pokémon, but strong against Grass-type.

![Fig 1. Vulpix, a Fire-type fox Pokémon from Generation 1 (also my favorite Pokémon!) ](images/vulpix.png){width="196"}

The goal of this assignment is to build a statistical learning model that can predict the **primary type** of a Pokémon based on its generation, legendary status, and six battle statistics. *This is an example of a **classification problem**, but these models can also be used for **regression problems***.

Read in the file and familiarize yourself with the variables using `pokemon_codebook.txt`.

### Exercise 1

Install and load the `janitor` package. Use its `clean_names()` function on the Pokémon data, and save the results to work with for the rest of the assignment. What happened to the data? Why do you think `clean_names()` is useful? 

**It changed the data by making all of the variable names into lowercase as well as replacing any blank soaces with underscores. This is useful because it is mor efficient to type variable names in lowercase, and it is unconventional to have spaces in variables when they need to be used in functions, models, and the like.**
```{r}
#install.packages('janitor')
library(janitor)
library(tidyverse)
library(tidymodels)
pokemon <- read_csv('/Users/kaylakatakis/Downloads/homework-5/data/Pokemon.csv')

pokemon <- clean_names(pokemon)
```

### Exercise 2

Using the entire data set, create a bar chart of the outcome variable, `type_1`.

How many classes of the outcome are there? Are there any Pokémon types with very few Pokémon? If so, which ones?

For this assignment, we'll handle the rarer classes by grouping them, or "lumping them," together into an 'other' category. [Using the `forcats` package](https://forcats.tidyverse.org/), determine how to do this, and **lump all the other levels together except for the top 6 most frequent** (which are Bug, Fire, Grass, Normal, Water, and Psychic).

Convert `type_1` and `legendary` to factors.

**There are 18 different classes of outcomes. The types with the fewest Pokemon are Flying, Fairy, and Ice.**
```{r}
ggplot(pokemon, aes(x = type_1)) + geom_bar()
#install.packages('forcats')
library(forcats)

pokemon <- pokemon %>% mutate(type_1 = fct_lump_n(type_1,6, other_level = 'Other'))

pokemon$type_1 <- factor(pokemon$type_1)
pokemon$legendary<- factor(pokemon$legendary,labels = c('FALSE', 'TRUE'))
```

### Exercise 3

Perform an initial split of the data. Stratify by the outcome variable. You can choose a proportion to use. Verify that your training and test sets have the desired number of observations.

Next, use *v*-fold cross-validation on the training set. Use 5 folds. Stratify the folds by `type_1` as well. *Hint: Look for a `strata` argument.*

Why do you think doing stratified sampling for cross-validation is useful?

**Stratified sampling for cross validation is useful because it keeps the same proportion of outcome classes in each fold, which helps train the models to be more accurate to the population than if the samples were truly random.**
```{r}
set.seed(1105)
pokemon_split <- initial_split(pokemon, prop = 0.7, strata = type_1)

pokemon_train <- training(pokemon_split)
pokemon_test <- testing(pokemon_split)

pokemon_folds <- vfold_cv(pokemon_train, v = 5, strata = type_1)
```

### Exercise 4

Create a correlation matrix of the training set, using the `corrplot` package. *Note: You can choose how to handle the categorical variables for this plot; justify your decision(s).*

What relationships, if any, do you notice?

**I chose to not include the non-numeric variables because they are few in number and less likely to be directly correlated with type_1. I noticed first that number is perfectly correlated with generation, which makes sense as pokemons are assigned numbers in the order of which they enter the game (the generation). I also noticed that there are strong correlations between total and each of the numeric stats for the pokemon, which also makes sense as the total variable is just a sum of the stats. There also relatively strong relationships between attack and sp_atk, defense and sp_def, defense and attack, sp_atk and sp_def, and sp_atk and speed.**
```{r}
library(corrplot)
pokemon %>% 
  select(is.numeric) %>% cor() %>%
  corrplot(method = 'square', type = 'lower', diag = TRUE)
```

### Exercise 5

Set up a recipe to predict `type_1` with `legendary`, `generation`, `sp_atk`, `attack`, `speed`, `defense`, `hp`, and `sp_def`.

-   Dummy-code `legendary` and `generation`;

-   Center and scale all predictors.
```{r}
pokemon_recipe <- recipe(type_1 ~ legendary + generation + sp_atk + attack +
                            speed + defense + hp + sp_def, pokemon) %>%
  step_dummy(all_nominal_predictors()) %>%
  step_normalize(all_predictors())
```

### Exercise 6

We'll be fitting and tuning an elastic net, tuning `penalty` and `mixture` (use `multinom_reg()` with the `glmnet` engine).

Set up this model and workflow. Create a regular grid for `penalty` and `mixture` with 10 levels each; `mixture` should range from 0 to 1. For this assignment, let `penalty` range from 0.01 to 3 (this is on the `identity_trans()` scale; note that you'll need to specify these values in base 10 otherwise).
```{r}
elastic <- multinom_reg(penalty = tune(), mixture = tune()) %>%
  set_engine('glmnet') %>%
  set_mode('classification')

elastic_wflow <- workflow() %>%
  add_model(elastic) %>%
  add_recipe(pokemon_recipe)

elastic_grid <- grid_regular(penalty(range = c(0.01, 3),
                                     trans = identity_trans()),
                        mixture(range = c(0, 1)),
                             levels = 10)
```

### Exercise 7

Now set up a random forest model and workflow. Use the `ranger` engine and set `importance = "impurity"`; we'll be tuning `mtry`, `trees`, and `min_n`. Using the documentation for `rand_forest()`, explain in your own words what each of these hyperparameters represent.

Create a regular grid with 8 levels each. You can choose plausible ranges for each hyperparameter. Note that `mtry` should not be smaller than 1 or larger than 8. **Explain why neither of those values would make sense.**

What type of model does `mtry = 8` represent?

**`mtry` represents the number of predictors that will be used in the tree, `trees` represents the number of trees, and `min_n` represents the minimal node size, or the minimum number of observations in a terminal node.**

**`mtry` should not be smaller than 1 because that will not be enough predictors to mae an accurate decision, and it should not be larger than 8 because the tree will then become too large and complex and risk overfitting. **

**A model with `mtry = 8` represents a tree that will use 8 randomly seletced predictors in decision making.**
```{r}
#install.packages('ranger')
forest <- rand_forest(mtry = tune(), trees = tune(), min_n = tune()) %>%
  set_engine('ranger', importance = 'impurity') %>%
  set_mode('classification')

forest_wflow <- workflow() %>%
  add_model(forest) %>%
  add_recipe(pokemon_recipe)

forest_grid <- grid_regular(mtry(range = c(1,8)), trees(range = c(100,500)), 
                            min_n(range = c(10,50)), levels = 8)
```

### Exercise 8

Fit all models to your folded data using `tune_grid()`.

**Note: Tuning your random forest model will take a few minutes to run, anywhere from 5 minutes to 15 minutes and up. Consider running your models outside of the .Rmd, storing the results, and loading them in your .Rmd to minimize time to knit. We'll go over how to do this in lecture.**

Use `autoplot()` on the results. What do you notice? Do larger or smaller values of `penalty` and `mixture` produce better ROC AUC? What about values of `min_n`, `trees`, and `mtry`?

What elastic net model and what random forest model perform the best on your folded data? (What specific values of the hyperparameters resulted in the optimal ROC AUC?) 

**Most of the values of `mixture` and `penalty` produce approximately the same ROC AUC, with the exception of a couple of values on the higher end decreasing performance dramatically. The hyperparameters for the random forest model were less obvious, but, on average, low `mtry` and `min_n` and higher `trees` produced better ROC_AUC.**

**The best performing elastic net model had hyperparameters `penalty = 0.00000` and `mixture = 0.88168`. The best performing random forest model had hyperparameters `mtry = 2`, `trees = 563`, and `min_n = 24`.**
```{r}
#elastic_tune <- tune_grid(
  #elastic_wflow,
  #pokemon_folds,
  #elastic_grid
#)
#forest_tune <- tune_grid(
  #forest_wflow,
  #pokemon_folds,
  #forest_grid,
  #metrics = metric_set(roc_auc)
#)

#save(forest_tune, file='forest_tune.rda')
#save(elastic_tune, file = 'elastic_tune.rda')

load('forest_tune.rda')
load('elastic_tune.rda')
autoplot(elastic_tune,metric = 'roc_auc')
autoplot(forest_tune,metric = 'roc_auc')

select_best(elastic_tune)
select_best(forest_tune)
```


### Exercise 9

Select your optimal [**random forest model**]{.underline} in terms of `roc_auc`. Then fit that model to your training set and evaluate its performance on the testing set.

Using the **training** set:

-   Create a variable importance plot, using `vip()`. *Note that you'll still need to have set `importance = "impurity"` when fitting the model to your entire training set in order for this to work.*

    -   What variables were most useful? Which were least useful? Are these results what you expected, or not?

**The most useful variable was `sp_atk`, while the least important were `generation` and `legendary`. I didn't know anything about Pokemon before this assignment, so I wasn't sure what to expect, but it makes sense that attack stats have an influence on type.**

Using the testing set:

-   Create plots of the different ROC curves, one per level of the outcome variable;

-   Make a heat map of the confusion matrix.
```{r}
#training metrics
#install.packages('vip')
library(vip)
best_forest <- select_best(forest_tune)
final_forest_wflow <- finalize_workflow(forest_wflow, best_forest)
final_forest <- fit(final_forest_wflow, data = pokemon_train)

#importance plot
final_forest %>% pull_workflow_fit() %>% vip()

# testing set

# ROC curves
augment(final_forest,new_data = pokemon_test) %>%
  roc_curve(type_1, .pred_Bug:.pred_Other) %>% autoplot()

# confusion matrix
augment(final_forest,new_data = pokemon_test) %>%
  conf_mat(type_1, .pred_class) %>% autoplot(type = 'heatmap')
```

### Exercise 10

How did your best random forest model do on the testing set?

Which Pokemon types is the model best at predicting, and which is it worst at? (Do you have any ideas why this might be?)
```{r}
augment(final_forest,new_data = pokemon_test) %>% metrics(truth = type_1, estimate =.pred_class)
```

**The best random forest model did not do well on the testing set with an accuracy rate of only about 43%, which is less than 50/50. The model is best at predicting Normal and Bug types (and Other, but there is more data to work with), while it is the worst at predicting Grass and Fire types. I think it is the worst at predicting the Grass and Fire types because there are the least amount of them and therefore less observations to use in decision making in the training set. The model tended to predict the types as Other most of the time.** 

## For 231 Students

### Exercise 11

In the 2020-2021 season, Stephen Curry, an NBA basketball player, made 337 out of 801 three point shot attempts (42.1%). Use bootstrap resampling on a sequence of 337 1's (makes) and 464 0's (misses). For each bootstrap sample, compute and save the sample mean (e.g. bootstrap FG% for the player). Use 1000 bootstrap samples to plot a histogram of those values. Compute the 99% bootstrap confidence interval for Stephen Curry's "true" end-of-season FG% using the quantile function in R. Print the endpoints of this interval.

### Exercise 12

Using the `abalone.txt` data from previous assignments, fit and tune a **random forest** model to predict `age`. Use stratified cross-validation and select ranges for `mtry`, `min_n`, and `trees`. Present your results. What was your final chosen model's **RMSE** on your testing set?
