## Linear Regression and KNN

For this assignment, we will be working with a data set from the UCI (University of California, Irvine) Machine Learning repository ([see website here](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Abalone)). The full data set consists of $4,177$ observations of abalone in Tasmania. (Fun fact: [Tasmania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tasmania "Tasmania") supplies about $25\%$ of the yearly world abalone harvest.)

![*Fig 1. Inside of an abalone shell.*](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1198/8002/products/1d89434927bffb6fd1786c19c2d921fb_2000x_652a2391-5a0a-4f10-966c-f759dc08635c_1024x1024.jpg?v=1582320404){width="152"}

The age of an abalone is typically determined by cutting the shell open and counting the number of rings with a microscope. The purpose of this data set is to determine whether abalone age (**number of rings + 1.5**) can be accurately predicted using other, easier-to-obtain information about the abalone.

The full abalone data set is located in the `\data` subdirectory. Read it into *R* using `read_csv()`. Take a moment to read through the codebook (`abalone_codebook.txt`) and familiarize yourself with the variable definitions.

Make sure you load the `tidyverse` and `tidymodels`!

### Question 1

Your goal is to predict abalone age, which is calculated as the number of rings plus 1.5. Notice there currently is no `age` variable in the data set. Add `age` to the data set.

Assess and describe the distribution of `age`.
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(tidymodels)
abalone <- read_csv('/Users/kaylakatakis/Downloads/homework-2 (1)/data/abalone.csv')
abalone$age <- abalone$rings + 1.5
#head(abalone)
hist(abalone$age)
```
It seems that most of the abalone are 10-16 years old, with what could potentially be a normal distribution, 
### Question 2

Split the abalone data into a training set and a testing set. Use stratified sampling. You should decide on appropriate percentages for splitting the data.

*Remember that you'll need to set a seed at the beginning of the document to reproduce your results.*
```{r}
set.seed(1105)
abalone_split <- initial_split(abalone, prop = 0.7,
                               strata = age)
abalone_train <- training(abalone_split)
abalone_test <- testing(abalone_split)
```

### Question 3

Using the **training** data, create a recipe predicting the outcome variable, `age`, with all other predictor variables. Note that you **should not** include `rings` to predict `age`. *Explain why you shouldn't use `rings` to predict `age`.*

Steps for your recipe:

1.  dummy code any categorical predictors

2.  create interactions between

    -   `type` and `shucked_weight`,
    -   `longest_shell` and `diameter`,
    -   `shucked_weight` and `shell_weight`

3.  center all predictors, and

4.  scale all predictors.

You'll need to investigate the `tidymodels` documentation to find the appropriate step functions to use.
```{r}
simple_abalone_recipe <- recipe(age ~type+longest_shell+diameter+ height+whole_weight+shucked_weight+viscera_weight+shell_weight,data = abalone_train) %>% step_dummy(all_nominal_predictors())

abalone_recipe <- simple_abalone_recipe%>% 
  step_interact(terms = ~starts_with('type'):shucked_weight+ longest_shell:diameter+ shucked_weight: shell_weight)

abalone_recipe <- abalone_recipe %>% step_center(starts_with('type'), longest_shell,diameter, height, whole_weight,shucked_weight, viscera_weight, shell_weight)

abalon_recipe <- abalone_recipe %>% step_scale(starts_with('type'), longest_shell,diameter, height, whole_weight,shucked_weight, viscera_weight, shell_weight)
```
We shouldn't use rings to predict age because in creating the age variable, we directly used the number of rings to calculate age. The two variables are the eact same, with aghe being shifted by 1.5.

### Question 4

Create and store a linear regression object using the `"lm"` engine.
```{r}
abalone_lm<- linear_reg() %>% 
  set_engine('lm')
```

### Question 5

Create and store a KNN object using the `"kknn"` engine. Specify `k = 7`.
```{r}
library(kknn)
abalone_knn <- nearest_neighbor(neighbors = 7) %>%
  set_engine('kknn') %>%
  set_mode('regression')
  
```

### Question 6

Now, for each of these models (linear regression and KNN):

1.  set up an empty workflow,
2.  add the model, and
3.  add the recipe that you created in Question 3.

Note that you should be setting up two separate workflows.

Fit both models to the training set.
```{r}
# linear
abalone_lm_wflow<- workflow() %>% 
  add_model(abalone_lm) %>%
  add_recipe(abalone_recipe)
abalone_lm_fit <- fit(abalone_lm_wflow,abalone_train)

# knn
abalone_knn_wflow <-workflow() %>%
  add_model(abalone_knn) %>%
  add_recipe(abalone_recipe)
abalone_knn_fit <- fit(abalone_knn_wflow, abalone_train)
```

### Question 7

Use your linear regression `fit()` object to predict the age of a hypothetical female abalone with longest_shell = 0.50, diameter = 0.10, height = 0.30, whole_weight = 4, shucked_weight = 1, viscera_weight = 2, and shell_weight = 1.
```{r}
abalone_obs <- data.frame(type = 'F', longest_shell =0.5,diameter = 0.1, height = 0.30, whole_weight = 4, shucked_weight = 1, viscera_weight = 2, shell_weight =1)

prediction <- predict(abalone_lm_fit, new_data = abalone_obs)
prediction
```

### Question 8

Now you want to assess your models' performance. To do this, use the `yardstick` package:

1.  Create a metric set that includes *R^2^*, RMSE (root mean squared error), and MAE (mean absolute error).
2.  Use `predict()` and `bind_cols()` to create a tibble of your model's predicted values from the **testing data** along with the actual observed ages (these are needed to assess your model's performance).
3.  Finally, apply your metric set to the tibble, report the results, and interpret the *R\^2* value.

Repeat these steps once for the linear regression model and for the KNN model.
Both the KNN and linear tests have relatively low *R\^2* values, at 0.472 and 0.548 respectively, meaning that the variability in the data was not explained well by either model. 
```{r}
#install.packages('yardstick')
library(yardstick)
metrics <- metric_set(rsq,rmse,mae)

lm_test_res <- predict(abalone_lm_fit, new_data = abalone_test %>% select(-age))
lm_test_res<- bind_cols(lm_test_res, abalone_test%>% select(age))
head(lm_test_res)

metrics(lm_test_res, truth = age, estimate = .pred)

knn_test_res <- predict(abalone_knn_fit, new_data = abalone_test %>% select(-age))
knn_test_res<- bind_cols(knn_test_res, abalone_test%>% select(age))
head(knn_test_res)

metrics(knn_test_res, truth = age, estimate = .pred)
```

### Question 9

Which model performed better on the testing data? Explain why you think this might be. Are you surprised by any of your results? Why or why not?

The linear model performed slightly better than the knn model on the testing data. I'm not surprised by these results, as the linear model is much more general, so it is not fitted as specifically to the training set and thus does better with new testing data. However, both models doing poorly may indicate that the data is not linear, but we still need a more flexible model.
### Required for 231 Students

In lecture, we presented the general bias-variance tradeoff, which takes the form:

$$
E[(y_0 - \hat{f}(x_0))^2]=Var(\hat{f}(x_0))+[Bias(\hat{f}(x_0))]^2+Var(\epsilon)
$$

where the underlying model $Y=f(X)+\epsilon$ satisfies the following:

-   $\epsilon$ is a zero-mean random noise term and $X$ is non-random (all randomness in $Y$ comes from $\epsilon$);
-   $(x_0, y_0)$ represents a test observation, independent of the training set, drawn from the same model;
-   $\hat{f}(.)$ is the estimate of $f$ obtained from the training set.

#### Question 10

Which term(s) in the bias-variance tradeoff above represent the reproducible error? Which term(s) represent the irreducible error?

#### Question 11

Using the bias-variance tradeoff above, demonstrate that the expected test error is always at least as large as the irreducible error.

#### Question 12

Prove the bias-variance tradeoff.

Hints:

-   use the definition of $Bias(\hat{f}(x_0))=E[\hat{f}(x_0)]-f(x_0)$;
-   reorganize terms in the expected test error by adding and subtracting $E[\hat{f}(x_0)]$
